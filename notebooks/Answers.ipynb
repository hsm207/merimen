    "I will start by generating explanations for my model's predictions using methods like LIME and/or SHAP values. These methods will tell us which of the features (the 11 Behaviors) had the biggest contribution to the customer's fraud score i.e. normalized reconstruction loss and the sensitivity of those features to the fraud score.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I will present these explanations to the human expert. If the explanations offered by the model is consistent with how the human expert would judge a customer based on the 11 behavior factors, then there is no reason for the human expert to not agree with the recommendations made by the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, if the recommendations is correct but the explanation is nonsensical/wrong, then more work needs to be done. In particular, we need to understand how the human expert evaluates the 11 behaviors e.g. is there a particular set of features that gets more attention or critical values that would cause the customer to be immediately flagged as FRAUD? I will then update the design of the autoencoder to encode the knowledge from the human expert."
